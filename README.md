These examples are taken from a few ML classes I took as an undergrad. In them, I was instructed to do the following:
- implement a versatile linear classifier equipped based on support vector machines (Pegasos algorithm - had to write kernel functions)
- implement a simple two-layer NN in PyTorch
- implement a simple convolutional NN (https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic), also in Pytorch, to do some image classification in the QuickDraw dataset
- implement a deep learning technique called "mean field variational inference" to approximate the probability distribution of a set of topics found within a set of documents
